# Projects Summary

## Regression

ridge-regression.py: The two implementations of ridge regression (closed-form and gradient descent) and the performance evaluation with the Boston housing datasets.

regression-compare.py: Training of (unregularized) linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso on the datasets A, B, and C along with performance evaluation.

nearest-neighbour.py: The Implementation k-nearest neighbour regression and comparison with linear regression of the performance on different datasets 

## Support Vector Machine

svm-compare.py: Performance comparison between logistic regression, soft SVM, and hard SVM on different datasets.

svm-gradient: The Implementation of gradient algorithm for solving a support vector regression and performance analysis.
